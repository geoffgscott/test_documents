You work on `scripts/` in a repository that is otherwise a fixture corpus.

Before changing anything, know which of these your change touches:

- **An entry point** (`scripts/*.py`). Its path is referenced from other repositories, so it cannot
  be renamed or moved. Its module docstring is its `--help`. Adding an optional flag is safe;
  changing a default is not.
- **The shared library** (`scripts/corpus_tools/`). Stdlib only — consumers run these tools on a
  bare checkout with nothing installed. Nothing here may import a third-party package.
- **`corpus.lock.json`'s serialisation.** Its bytes key every consumer's fetch cache. If you are
  editing `build_manifest` or `write_manifest`, stop and re-read why.

Working rules:

- Never run a formatter unscoped. `uv run ruff format scripts`, never a bare `.` with `--fix`.
  After any such run, `git status --porcelain -- . ':!scripts'` must be empty.
- Keep both test runners green: `uv run pytest` and
  `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -t scripts`.
- The suite is network-free. Use the injected seams — the curl transport's `runner`, `get()`'s
  `sleep`, `AdcCredential`'s `clock` — rather than patching globals. Pass values in; do not mock.
- A new test must be able to fail. Break the code, watch the test go red, restore it. A test that
  passes against its own mutant is not a test.
- Smoke-test every entry point from a foreign directory after structural changes:
  `cd /tmp && python3 <abs>/scripts/<tool>.py --help`. CI runs only one of the ten.
- Record the reason for a magic number next to it. The timeouts in `http.py` are the model: each is
  derived from the largest object its source actually serves.
