"""Every entry point must still start, from anywhere, on a bare interpreter.

~keep This exists because the risk it covers is real and everything else misses it. The unit tests
import `corpus_tools` directly, so they never exercise the path a consumer takes; this repository's
CI runs exactly one of the ten tools; and around fourteen places in the xberg repo tell developers
to run `python3 test_documents/scripts/fetch_corpus.py` when a fixture is missing.

It has already earned its place. Moving the EPUB tools into a subpackage left two names unimported
and a `__file__`-relative data path pointing two directories too deep — `ruff` reported nothing, the
whole unit suite stayed green, and `fetch_epub_edge_cases.py` raised NameError at import.

Run from a temporary directory on purpose: a tool that only works when the current directory happens
to be the repository is broken for every consumer, and running from inside the repo hides that.
