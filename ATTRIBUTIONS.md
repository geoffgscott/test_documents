- **Modifications:** human word `utf8_string` values grouped into lines by geometry and concatenated in reading order into GT. Verbatim (null "." markers dropped).

## ds4sd/DocLayNet (IBM)

- **Citation:** Pfitzmann et al., "DocLayNet: A Large Human-Annotated Dataset for Document-Layout Analysis", KDD 2022.
- **Source:** <https://huggingface.co/datasets/ds4sd/DocLayNet-v1.1>
- **License:** CDLA-Permissive-1.0

- **Modifications:** authoritative PDF text cells linearized in reading order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right). No OCR and no model used; text is DocLayNet's verbatim PDF-layer cell text.

## Diagram fixtures (this repository)

- **Source:** authored here, not derived from any third-party dataset. The first four Graphviz fixtures were contributed by Parman Mohammadalizadeh (@MannXo) in xberg-io/test_documents#1.
- **License:** same as this repository.
- **Used here:** `diagrams/svg/*.svg` and `diagrams/pdf/*.pdf` plus their `diagrams/src/*.{dot,mmd,puml,fodg,html}` sources, `diagrams/manifest.json`, and `ground_truth/dot/*.dot`.
- **Rendering tools:** the source graphs are ours; the SVGs and PDFs are what each renderer emitted from them. Graphviz 15.1.1 (`dot`/`neato`) is EPL-1.0, Mermaid CLI 11.16.0 is MIT, PlantUML 1.2026.0 is GPL, LibreOffice 26.2.5.2 is MPL-2.0, librsvg 2.62.3 (`rsvg-convert`) is LGPL-2.1-or-later, qpdf 12.3.2 is Apache-2.0, and Google Chrome 151 is proprietary. None of these licenses reaches the output: rendering a document is not a derivative work of the renderer, and PlantUML says so explicitly in its FAQ. No tool binary, jar or stylesheet is redistributed here.
- **Embedded fonts:** a PDF carries subsetted glyph outlines of whatever fonts the renderer reached for, so the fixtures under `diagrams/pdf/` do redistribute font data. Each family was checked against the OS/2 `fsType` bit of the system font it came from, which is where a font states its own embedding terms: Helvetica and Liberation Sans report 0 (installable, no restriction), Times New Roman and Trebuchet MS report 8 (editable embedding). All four permit it. `scripts/build_diagram_pdfs.py` holds that allowlist and fails a build that reaches for anything outside it. That check is why `graphviz_cjk` ships as SVG only: macOS's Songti reports `fsType` 2, restricted, which forbids embedding without the owner's permission, so no CJK PDF is published until an open-licensed CJK face is available to render one.
- **Modifications:** every fixture whose producer states its own graph also ships as a `*_geometry.svg` variant with that metadata removed by `scripts/strip_svg_graph_metadata.py` — Graphviz writes the node ids and the full edge list into `<title>` elements and again into XML comments; Mermaid into `id="L_start_auth_0"`, again into `data-id`, and the edge's waypoints into `data-points`; PlantUML into `id="Read config-to-Open input"`, again into a comment, again into a `data-entity-1`/`data-entity-2` pair, and once more into a `<?plantuml-src?>` processing instruction carrying its whole deflated source; and LibreOffice by tagging each group with its shape kind, which across a whole file is the node/edge partition. A fixture that names its own answer cannot measure geometry recovery. Stripping removes no geometry: each variant renders to a byte-identical PNG. `nested_transforms.svg`, `icon_nodes.svg`, `mixed_page.svg`, `two_diagrams.svg` and the three `negative_*.svg` files are hand-written. Ground truth is the source graph restated by node label, so it is independent of any recogniser's numbering.

## xberg math corpus

- **Citation:** assembled for xberg from published documents that carry mathematics, one per notation and container the extractor supports.
- **Source:** 123 upstream projects and publishers. Each document's source URL is in `MATH_PROVENANCE.md`.
- **License:** per document. 136 are vendored under permissive terms, chiefly MIT (36), CC-BY-4.0 (25), Apache-2.0 (21), US public domain (13), BSD-3-Clause (12) and MPL-2.0 (5).

- **Used here:** 178 mathematics articles, reference.
- **Modifications:** none.

## Synthetic scanned math pages

- **Citation:** none; generated for this corpus.
- **Source:** rendered with matplotlib mathtext, rasterized at 300 DPI, binarized, and packed as CCITT G4 PDFs with no text layer, to mirror the shape of a scanned textbook page (xberg issue #1385).
- **License:** MIT, as our own work.
- **Used here:** `pdf_scanned/synthetic_math_*.pdf`, four pages that carry display equations only as pixels. They exercise formula detection and recognition on scanned input, including a skewed scan.
- **Modifications:** not applicable.

## xberg benchmark-harness fixtures

- **Citation:** none; part of the xberg repository.
- **Source:** <https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg>, `tools/benchmark-harness/fixtures/split/memo_marketing_form.pdf`, page 1, rasterized at 300 DPI and packed as a bilevel CCITT G4 scan.
- **License:** MIT, as our own work.
- **Used here:** `pdf_scanned/memo_prose_scanned.pdf`, the negative case: a scanned page with no mathematics, which must yield no formulas.
- **Modifications:** rasterized and binarized from the vector original.

## Xberg issue #1484 two-column gutter reproduction

- **Source:** authored by Eric Evers (`@erichevers`) and attached to
  <https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg/issues/1484> as a minimal reproduction.
- **License:** MIT, as a contribution to the Xberg test corpus.
- **Used here:** `pdf/issue-1484-two-column-hanging-number-gutter.pdf`, a two-page A4 fixture whose
  first page uses hanging clause numbers and whose unnumbered second page is the control.
- **Modifications:** renamed for stable corpus addressing; document bytes are otherwise unchanged.

## Xberg issue #1542 prose-paragraph-as-table reproduction

- **Source:** authored by Eric Evers (`@erichevers`) and attached to
  <https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg/issues/1542> as a minimal reproduction.
- **License:** MIT, as a contribution to the Xberg test corpus.
- **Used here:** `pdf/issue-1542-prose-paragraph-shredded-into-table.pdf`, a single unruled A4 page
  carrying three three-line body paragraphs. Paragraphs two and three share their first two lines
  verbatim and differ only in the last line, numeric in one and alphabetic in the other, so the page
  is a self-contained A/B for the table heuristic.
- **Modifications:** renamed for stable corpus addressing; document bytes are otherwise unchanged.

## Synthetic Arabic and Hebrew right-to-left fixtures

- **Source:** authored for this corpus. The exact logical-order HTML sources are
  `pdf_scanned/sources/rtl_arabic.html` (SHA-256
  `1e50529cd42d3395c883b2bafba9d7639b50d22c50a97913ea098a4cf525b8f5`) and
  `pdf_scanned/sources/rtl_hebrew.html` (SHA-256
  `0b937b15785fb79b3e647c53551ffde7ad26a65668e86922890239668ce1e5ed`).
- **License:** MIT, as our own work.
- **Used here:** two native A4 PDFs (`pdf/rtl_*_native.pdf`), two 300-DPI page images
  (`images/rtl_*_300dpi.png`), and two image-only CCITT-G4 PDFs
  (`pdf_scanned/rtl_*_scanned.pdf`). Each language covers headings, prose, numbered lists, table
  cells, punctuation, ASCII numbers, and embedded left-to-right identifiers such as
  `REQ-2026-104`, `OCR-v2.1`, and `A-17`.
- **Ground truth:** the six `.txt` files under `ground_truth/pdf/` and `ground_truth/images/` copy
  the authored text in logical Unicode order. They were checked against the rendered pages; no OCR
  or extractor output was used to create them.
- **Rendering:** LibreOffice 26.8.0.3
  (`bce0998afefdbc355585ca324285661a2170ba77`) exported the HTML sources to PDF. Its bundled Noto
  Sans Arabic and Noto Sans Hebrew fonts are OFL-1.1. The embedded regular font inputs have SHA-256
  `d6efa4c9fac8ecefd2de19676acc3a396ba7aee99ba7a2d513950246841b6725` and
  `671951828bd5c95db818e5bb12dcea2d0c0dda00311888522be061ee6835125e`; the bold inputs have SHA-256
  `457926cb001ac787dc7415c89e6f5b1c4ce3a0f2c91d0cabc1bc19a05638e7de` and
  `96f88305d31a8432f0fe6648c853cb9ef77db8e52ada8948ed0c577037d45423`.
- **Scan derivation:** Poppler 26.10.0 rasterized each native PDF at 300 DPI. ImageMagick 7.1.2-32
  converted the page to bilevel Group 4 TIFF, and libtiff 4.7.2 wrapped it as a PDF. `pdftotext`
  returns zero text bytes for both scanned PDFs, and `pdfimages -list` reports exactly one 2481 ×
  3508, 300-DPI, one-bit image per file.
- **Modifications:** the scan variants are raster derivatives of the corresponding native fixture;
  their visible content is otherwise unchanged.

## Pinkas Dataset historical Hebrew manuscript page

- **Citation:** Irina Rabaev, Berat Kurar Bakarat, and Jihad El-Sana, *The Pinkas Dataset*,
  ICDAR 2019, DOI `10.1109/ICDAR.2019.00122_dataset`.
- **Source:** Zenodo record <https://zenodo.org/records/3569694>, version 1, published 10 December
  2019. The deposited archive `pinkas_dataset.zip` has MD5
  `802f14fbdb400efab9cb0808c3620be8` and contains the paired upstream files
  `Page 132_1.jpg` and `Page 132_1.xml`.
- **License:** CC BY 4.0, declared by the open-access Zenodo dataset record:
  <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>.
- **Selection evidence:** HebOCRBench commit `2cb763b50e70ed01991894cd0024b2a91b12db37`
  identifies pages 132_1 through 134_2 as its locked, public Pinkas test split and records exactly
  38 line samples for `Page 132_1.xml`:
  <https://github.com/office883/HebOCRBench/blob/2cb763b50e70ed01991894cd0024b2a91b12db37/src/hebocrbench/converters/pinkas_webdataset.py#L23-L30>.
- **Used here:** `images/pinkas_page_132_1.jpg` (SHA-256
  `87129d6203378a4bf20ecf82f197c8eca6b3f7dde087ca0963e94849b9e697f7`) and the upstream PAGE
  2018-07-15 annotation `ground_truth/pagexml/pinkas_page_132_1.xml` (SHA-256
  `97012de884d16b1946f3dc009c7e8c4395561b8179375207a544494efeb82ffb`). The page is a real
  historical Hebrew manuscript containing mixed Hebrew and Yiddish handwriting.
- **Ground truth:** `ground_truth/images/pinkas_page_132_1.txt` is NFC-normalized logical-order
  text derived from the four nonempty region-level PAGE `TextEquiv/Unicode` values in document
  order. Their embedded line breaks are preserved, with one blank line between regions. This uses
  all 38 annotated text lines and excludes the annotation's coordinate-only temporary line, which
  has no line-level or region-level transcription. The page was visually inspected for content,
  orientation, and region sequence; no OCR or Xberg output was used to create the oracle.
- **Modifications:** the JPEG and PAGE XML bytes are unchanged; only the stable corpus filenames
  differ from the upstream names. The plaintext ground truth applies the derivation above.

## City of Sugar Land, Texas — Ordinance No. 2197

- **Citation:** City of Sugar Land, Texas, Ordinance No. 2197 (adopted 4 August 2020), a zoning change for approximately 0.7906 acres at Lake Pointe Parkway and Creek Bend Drive.
- **Source:** City of Sugar Land public records.
- **License:** US public domain. Texas municipal ordinances are edicts of government and carry no copyright.
- **Used here:** `pdf_scanned/ordinance_2197_scanned.pdf`, a 16-page office-scanner capture (Xerox AltaLink C8045, JBIG2 masks over JPEG backgrounds) with no text layer. It pairs long-form legal prose with signature blocks, a recorded survey plat, and six architectural exhibit sheets whose labels are rotated 90 degrees, so it exercises OCR reading order across mixed upright and landscape content.
- **Modifications:** none to the document. Ground truth in `ground_truth/pdf/ordinance_2197.txt` was produced with PaddleOCR and proofread page by page against 300 DPI renders. It covers the ten prose pages in full, including the handwritten adoption dates; the six drawing sheets are represented only by the printed title-block text that could be read with confidence, since their surveyor and hand-lettered CAD annotations are not legibly transcribable.

  `23b1747ff9b7e408244c62dd3981238ea193b25a`.
- **License:** BSD-3-Clause; the upstream license is retained at
  `vendored/executablebooks-myst-nb/LICENSE`.
- **Used here:** `basic_unrun.md`, a MyST/Jupytext text notebook with notebook front matter and a
  code-cell directive; `with_eval.md`, which covers inline and block evaluation plus an evaluated
  figure; and `hide_cell_content.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook whose cells carry `hide-input`,
  `hide-output`, and `hide-cell` tags.
- **Modifications:** none to the fixture bytes; files were relocated under
  `vendored/executablebooks-myst-nb/`.
